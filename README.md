Feel free to open an issue and I'll take a look.

Here's how the app works:

When the user clicks on a button, the page grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.

When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.

Under every gif, there is its rating (PG, G, so on).

The form on the page takes a value from a user input box and adds it to buttons.
